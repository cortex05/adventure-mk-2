# Adventure game Mark 2

- This is the second iteration of a text based game made to explore Python concepts I am learning about.

- This verison is meant to improve on the original game both in functionality and the cleanliness of the code base.

# New features

- These are the Objectives that I plan on implementing in this iteration. THey Include:

- Make a "Main Menu" That can start a new game when the previous one ends. From HERE, have an option to shut down the app.

- Make the player inventoy be object based. Maybe have different types of items like consumables vs key quest items.

- THe old battle loop is functional, but very rigid. Adding new scenarios was difficult at the end of the last iteration. Make it more flexible.

- The old verison had limited handling for when a user entered invalid options. Tighten this up across all situations.

- The swamp loop was only 4 navigation areas. Make it bigger so there is more to be done.

- Have some kind of compass for the navigation options? This might change depending on text...

- Better balance to the combat. I want progression, but it needs to be adjustable for the troublshooting and accessing later parts of the game.

- Some kind of weapon that the player uses, that can then be swapped for a better one. Maybe some Armor if you have time.

- Experience system. Need to level up.
